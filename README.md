# Photo Processing

## Organization
Photos are renamed and organized by date via `organize-photos.py`. This script is based off of [work by @cliss](https://gist.github.com/cliss/6854904) which, in turn was based off of a [script by Dr. Drang](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2013/10/photo-management-via-the-finder/).
